1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
So  this

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,500
Indian  company

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,259
called  Smolest

4
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:02,879
.A .A

5
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,180
have  released

6
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,839
in  service

7
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:04,820
for  real

8
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,259
time  text

9
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:05,440
to

10
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,179
speak  conversion.

11
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:07,059
So  it

12
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:07,559
gives  very

13
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,279
human  sounding

14
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,140
voice  instead

15
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,500
of  very

16
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:10,900
robotic.

17
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:11,820
We  can

18
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,320
test  their

19
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,839
demo  by

20
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,300
going  to

21
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,019
their  dashboard

22
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:14,640
over  here.

23
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:15,320
So  you

24
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,980
can  see

25
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,379
I  page

26
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:16,859
just  show

27
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:17,539
you.

28
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,219
So  they

29
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,000
give  very

30
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,460
a  lot

31
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,120
of  options

32
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,719
to  choose

33
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,059
from.

34
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:21,699
So  there

35
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:22,420
are  mostly

36
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,179
American  and

37
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:24,300
English  accent

38
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,679
as  well

39
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,140
as  language.

40
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:25,839
We  can

41
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,219
choose  the

42
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:26,739
language  over

43
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:26,960
here.

44
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:31,800
So  I

45
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,100
will  just

46
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,659
test  one

47
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,140
of  the

48
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,579
other  super

49
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,880
this  voice.

50
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:35,880
And  if

51
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,079
I  see

52
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,219
this,  I

53
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:37,600
have  this

54
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,280
English  text

55
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,700
now.

56
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:38,960
If  I

57
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,579
click  generate.

58
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,420
The  sun

59
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:40,899
sets  over

60
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:41,420
the  quiet

61
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:41,899
village.

62
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,020
Casting  a

63
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,600
warm  glow

64
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,320
across  the

65
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,960
fields.

66
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:45,579
You  can

67
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,000
see  it

68
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,679
sounds  very

69
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,659

70
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:48,179

00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:48,659
of  robotic.

72
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:49,740
Now  I

73
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,060
will  just

74
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,500
